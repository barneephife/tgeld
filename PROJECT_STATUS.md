# Tascheged - Allowance Tracker Project Status

## Current Status
The project has made significant progress with the Task Management Interface now functional and initial unit tests implemented.

## Completed Features
- Basic application shell with header and sidebar navigation
- Task Management Interface including:
  - Task list view with filtering and sorting
  - Add new task functionality
  - Edit existing task functionality
  - Delete task with confirmation
  - Toggle task visibility (Active/Inactive)
- Integration of shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Initial unit tests for TaskManagement component

## In Progress
- Expanding test coverage for Task Management Interface

## Upcoming Features
- User Management Interface
- Parent/Child Mode Toggle
- Global Settings
- Enhanced Task Completion Interface
- Piggy Bank Account Interface
- Payday Interface
- Database Integration
- Authentication System

## Next Steps
1. Expand unit tests for Task Management components
2. Implement tests for AddTaskModal, EditTaskModal, and DeleteConfirmationModal
3. Perform integration testing for task CRUD operations
4. Update component documentation
5. Add usage instructions in README.md
6. Begin implementation of User Management Interface

## Action Plan: Testing and Documentation

### 1. Unit Testing
- [x] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- [x] Write initial tests for TaskManagement component
- [ ] Write tests for AddTaskModal component
- [ ] Write tests for EditTaskModal component
- [ ] Write tests for DeleteConfirmationModal component
- [ ] Add tests for filtering and sorting functionality

### 2. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test task creation flow
- [ ] Test task editing flow
- [ ] Test task deletion flow
- [ ] Test task filtering and sorting

### 3. Documentation
- [ ] Update component documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Add section in README.md for Task Management feature
- [ ] Document API endpoints for tasks

### 4. Refinement
- [ ] Address any bugs or issues found during testing
- [ ] Optimize performance if needed
- [ ] Enhance accessibility features

## Future Considerations
- Implement remaining features (User Management, Parent/Child Mode Toggle, etc.)
- Set up continuous integration and deployment pipeline
- Plan for database integration and migration from mock data

## Recent Updates
- Implemented icon selector for tasks using predefined SVG icons
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing
- Implemented initial unit tests for TaskManagement component

## Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Expand the icon set for tasks
- [ ] Increase test coverage for TaskManagement component
- [ ] Implement tests for modal components

## Notes for Future Development
- To add more task icons:
  1. Download SVG icons from sources like Heroicons, Feather Icons, or Lucide
  2. Add new SVG files to the `/public/icons/` directory
  3. Update the `icons` array in `components/icon-selector.tsx`
- Consider implementing a more dynamic icon loading system for easier management of a large icon set
- As test coverage expands, consider setting up a code coverage tool to track testing progress
