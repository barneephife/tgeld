# Tascheged - Allowance Tracker Project Status

## Current Status
The project has made significant progress with the Task Management Interface now functional and initial unit tests implemented. The User Management Interface is now complete, with AddUserModal, EditUserModal, and DeleteConfirmationModal components implemented. Default icon and sound options have been added, with the ability to select no sound for a user.

## Completed Features
- Basic application shell with header and sidebar navigation
- Task Management Interface including:
  - Task list view with filtering and sorting
  - Add new task functionality
  - Edit existing task functionality
  - Delete task with confirmation
  - Toggle task visibility (Active/Inactive)
- Integration of shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Initial unit tests for TaskManagement component
- User Management Interface structure
- AddUserModal component for adding new users
- EditUserModal component for editing existing users
- DeleteConfirmationModal component for confirming user deletion
- Default icon and sound options for users
- Option to select no sound for a user

## In Progress
- Expanding test coverage for Task Management Interface
- Finalizing User Management Interface

## Upcoming Features
- [x] Complete implementation of User Management Interface
  - [x] Create basic structure for User Management component
  - [x] Implement AddUserModal component
  - [x] Implement EditUserModal component
  - [x] Implement DeleteConfirmationModal component
  - [ ] Implement CRUD operations for user management
  - [ ] Ensure at least one Parent account exists and restrict role modifications

## Action Plan: User Management Implementation

### 1. User Interface Components
- [x] Create basic UserManagement component
- [x] Implement AddUserModal component
- [x] Implement EditUserModal component
- [x] Implement DeleteConfirmationModal component
- [x] Add icon and sound selectors to AddUserModal and EditUserModal

### 2. API Development
- [ ] Create API endpoint for fetching users
- [ ] Create API endpoint for adding a new user
- [ ] Create API endpoint for updating a user
- [ ] Create API endpoint for deleting a user

### 3. Integration
- [ ] Connect UserManagement component to API endpoints
- [ ] Implement error handling and loading states

### 4. Business Logic
- [ ] Implement logic to ensure at least one Parent account exists
- [ ] Add restrictions for modifying user roles

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for UserManagement component
- [ ] Write unit tests for AddUserModal component
- [ ] Write unit tests for EditUserModal component
- [ ] Write unit tests for DeleteConfirmationModal component
- [ ] Perform integration testing for user CRUD operations

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Update component documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Add section in README.md for User Management feature
- [ ] Document API endpoints for user management

## Recent Updates
- Implemented API endpoints for user management (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Connected UserManagement component to API endpoints
- Replaced mock data with API calls in UserManagement component

## Next Steps
1. Implement business logic for user roles and restrictions
   - Ensure at least one Parent account exists
   - Add restrictions for modifying user roles
2. Start writing unit tests for User Management components
3. Update documentation to reflect new user management features
4. Implement error handling and loading states in UserManagement component

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider implementing a more dynamic icon loading system for easier management of a large icon set
- As test coverage expands, consider setting up a code coverage tool to track testing progress
