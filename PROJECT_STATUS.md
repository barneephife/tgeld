# Tascheged - Allowance Tracker Project Status

## Current Status

- Parent/Child mode toggle has been successfully implemented
- PiggyBank interface now correctly shows/hides "Add Funds" and "Withdraw Funds" buttons based on the selected mode
- Global state management for Parent/Child mode is now in place using React Context
- Components have been updated to work with Next.js 13+ by using the 'use client' directive where necessary
- Build issues related to client-side rendering have been resolved

## Known Issues

- TypeScript and linter errors exist in some components, particularly:
  - components/piggy-bank.tsx
  - hooks/useParentChildMode.tsx
  - components/ClientLayout.tsx

## Next Steps

- Resolve TypeScript and linter errors in affected components
- Implement Parent/Child mode restrictions for other components (e.g., TaskManagement, UserManagement)
- Add user authentication to properly manage Parent/Child roles
- Enhance error handling and edge cases for Parent/Child mode switching
- Review and update type definitions for modal components (AddFundsModal, WithdrawFundsModal, TransactionsModal)

## Upcoming Features (Beyond Payday Interface)

- [ ] Implement Task Completion Interface for children
- [ ] Develop Piggy Bank Account Interface

## Notes for Next Session

- Focus on completing items 3-7 in the Payday Interface Implementation Plan
- Consider implementing error handling and loading states for API calls (currently using mock data)

## Important Notes for Future Development

### User Type Definition Issue

When implementing new features or interfaces (such as the Piggy Bank Interface), be aware of the following issue we encountered with the User type definition:

1. The current User type in `app/types/user.ts` is missing several properties that are being used in various components. These include:

   - `icon`
   - `sound`
   - `birthday`

2. This discrepancy is causing TypeScript errors in components like `EditUserModal`, `UserCard`, and `UserManagement`.

3. Before implementing new features or interfaces that interact with User data, ensure that the User type is updated to include all necessary properties. The correct User type should look something like this:

   ```typescript
   type User = {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     icon: string;
     sound: string | null;
     birthday: string;
     role: 'parent' | 'child';
   };
   ```

4. After updating the User type, review and update all components that use User data to ensure they're using the correct properties and that no TypeScript errors remain.

5. This issue highlights the importance of keeping type definitions in sync with actual data structures and usage across the application. Regular audits of type definitions and their usage can help prevent similar issues in the future.

Remember to address this issue before proceeding with the implementation of the Piggy Bank Interface or any other features that interact with User data.

## Project Structure

The current project structure is as follows:

## Git Commit Preparation Process

When preparing for a git commit, always follow these steps:

1. Review and update the CHANGELOG.md file with any new features, changes, or fixes.
2. Update the PROJECT_STATUS.md file to reflect the current state of the project, including any completed tasks or new known issues.
3. Prepare a concise but descriptive commit message that summarizes the changes made.
4. Run any linters or tests to ensure code quality and catch any potential issues.
5. Stage the changes using `git add .`
6. Commit the changes using `git commit -m "Your prepared commit message"`
7. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin main` (or the appropriate branch name)

Following these steps ensures that the project documentation remains up-to-date and that commit messages are informative and consistent.
