# Tascheged - Allowance Tracker Project Status

## Current Status

We have implemented the Task Management and User Management interfaces. We are now working on the Payday Interface, which will allow parents to review and approve completed tasks.

## Current Focus: Payday Interface Implementation

### Completed Features

- Basic application shell with header and sidebar navigation
- User Management Interface (CRUD operations, API integration)
- Task Management Interface (list view, CRUD operations, visibility toggle)

### Payday Interface Implementation Plan

1. Basic component structure and layout (Completed)

   - [x] Set up main component file (components/payday-interface.tsx)
   - [x] Create layout with header, filters, and main content area

2. Mock data integration (Completed)

   - [x] Create mock data for completed tasks and users
   - [x] Implement functions to simulate API calls

3. CompletedTaskCard component (In Progress)

   - [ ] Design card to display individual completed tasks
   - [ ] Include task details, completion date, and approval status

4. Task list view

   - [x] Create scrollable list of CompletedTaskCards
   - [x] Implement sorting functionality (by completion date, payout value)

5. Filtering and grouping functionality

   - [x] Add filter controls for selecting specific users
   - [ ] Implement grouping tasks by user or time interval

6. Bulk selection and action controls

   - [ ] Create controls for selecting multiple tasks
   - [ ] Implement approve and reject buttons for bulk actions

7. Approval/rejection logic

   - [x] Create functions to handle individual task approvals/rejections
   - [ ] Update UI to reflect changes in task status
   - [ ] Implement payout value modification before approval

8. Summary statistics

   - [ ] Display total tasks, total payout value, and other relevant statistics

9. Pagination/infinite scrolling

   - [ ] Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large numbers of tasks

10. Detailed view and confirmation modals
    - [ ] Create a modal for viewing detailed task information
    - [ ] Implement confirmation modals for approvals and rejections

### Next Steps

- Complete the CompletedTaskCard component
- Implement bulk selection and action controls
- Add summary statistics
- Enhance approval/rejection logic with payout value modification

## Upcoming Features (Beyond Payday Interface)

- [ ] Implement Task Completion Interface for children
- [ ] Develop Piggy Bank Account Interface

## Notes for Next Session

- Focus on completing items 3-7 in the Payday Interface Implementation Plan
- Consider implementing error handling and loading states for API calls (currently using mock data)

## Important Notes for Future Development

### User Type Definition Issue

When implementing new features or interfaces (such as the Piggy Bank Interface), be aware of the following issue we encountered with the User type definition:

1. The current User type in `app/types/user.ts` is missing several properties that are being used in various components. These include:

   - `icon`
   - `sound`
   - `birthday`

2. This discrepancy is causing TypeScript errors in components like `EditUserModal`, `UserCard`, and `UserManagement`.

3. Before implementing new features or interfaces that interact with User data, ensure that the User type is updated to include all necessary properties. The correct User type should look something like this:

   ```typescript
   type User = {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     icon: string;
     sound: string | null;
     birthday: string;
     role: 'parent' | 'child';
   };
   ```

4. After updating the User type, review and update all components that use User data to ensure they're using the correct properties and that no TypeScript errors remain.

5. This issue highlights the importance of keeping type definitions in sync with actual data structures and usage across the application. Regular audits of type definitions and their usage can help prevent similar issues in the future.

Remember to address this issue before proceeding with the implementation of the Piggy Bank Interface or any other features that interact with User data.

## Project Structure

The current project structure is as follows:

## Git Commit Preparation Process

When preparing for a git commit, always follow these steps:

1. Review and update the CHANGELOG.md file with any new features, changes, or fixes.
2. Update the PROJECT_STATUS.md file to reflect the current state of the project, including any completed tasks or new known issues.
3. Prepare a concise but descriptive commit message that summarizes the changes made.
4. Run any linters or tests to ensure code quality and catch any potential issues.
5. Stage the changes using `git add .`
6. Commit the changes using `git commit -m "Your prepared commit message"`
7. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin main` (or the appropriate branch name)

Following these steps ensures that the project documentation remains up-to-date and that commit messages are informative and consistent.
