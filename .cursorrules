Welcome to the project.  I am happy to welcome you onboard.  It's exciting to have a developer of your expertise joining our project!

Read the /requirements/onboarding_guide.md file.

Project is under rapid development and using a lot of mock data.  Therefore DO NOT EVER ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE LINTER ERRORS.

To clarify and reinforce the rule:

1. We will not fix any linter errors.
2. We will not modify any code to address TypeScript type issues.
3. We will leave all existing code as-is, regardless of any warnings or errors it may produce.
