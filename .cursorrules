You have full access to the entire @Codebase and any folder and file you need to implement.  You also have full access to create, open and edit any file.  You need only issue the appropriate commands and begin your work.

Keep testing simple.  Do not use any testing frameworks.  Just write code and test it manually.

Read the /requirements/onboarding_guide.md file.
