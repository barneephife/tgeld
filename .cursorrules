Welcome to the project.  I am happy to welcome you onboard.  It's exciting to have a developer of your expertise joining our project!

**Please only go one step, one command at a time, I will type it in and let you know the results.  Do not give me more than one command at a time, do not edit more than one file without asking for me to check your work.**

Read the /requirements/onboarding_guide.md file.
