# Manual Testing Procedure

1. Before making any code changes, create a new branch from the main branch.
2. Implement the desired changes in the new branch.
3. Manually test the changes:
   - Verify that the new functionality works as expected
   - Check that existing features are not negatively impacted
   - Test on different devices and screen sizes
   - Ensure that there are no console errors
4. If issues are found, fix them and repeat step 3.
5. Once testing is successful, commit the changes and create a pull request.
6. Another team member should review the changes and perform additional manual testing.
7. If the review is successful, merge the pull request into the main branch.
8. After merging, perform a final round of manual testing on the main branch to ensure everything works correctly.
