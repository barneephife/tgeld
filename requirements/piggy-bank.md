# Piggy Bank Interface Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the current configuration of the Piggy Bank interface and provides a step-by-step guide for implementing a mock-up. It is intended for developers who will be responsible for building and tracking the progress of the Piggy Bank feature.

## Current Configuration

The **Piggy Bank** interface is currently set up as a placeholder within the project, indicating future development. Below are the relevant files and their current status:

### Component File: `components/piggy-bank.tsx`

- **Description:** When the user navigates to `/piggy-bank`, the `PiggyBank` component is rendered within the `MainContent` area of the `AppShell`.

## Steps to Build a Mock-Up for the Piggy Bank Page

To develop a comprehensive mock-up for the Piggy Bank interface, follow these steps:

### 1. Define the UI Requirements

- **Features to Include:**
  - **Savings Balance:** Display the current amount saved in the piggy bank.
  - **Add Funds:** Button or form to add money to the piggy bank.
  - **Withdraw Funds:** Option to withdraw money from the piggy bank.
  - **Transaction History:** List of all deposits and withdrawals.
  - **Visual Indicators:** Icons or animations representing the piggy bank status.

### 2. Design the Layout

- **Header Section:** Title and possibly a brief description.
- **Balance Display:** Prominently show the current savings.
- **Action Buttons:** "Add Funds" and "Withdraw Funds" buttons.
- **Transaction List:** Scrollable area listing all transactions.
- **Visual Elements:** Incorporate icons from `public/icons/` for consistency.

### 3. Utilize Existing UI Components

- **Buttons:** Use the existing `Button` component for actions.
- **Cards:** Utilize `Card` components to encapsulate different sections like balance and transactions.
- **Modals:** Implement modals for adding or withdrawing funds using existing modal components.

### 4. Implement State Management

- **State Variables:**
  - `balance`: To track the current savings.
  - `transactions`: An array to store transaction history.
  - `isAddModalOpen` & `isWithdrawModalOpen`: Booleans to control modal visibility.
- **Handlers:**
  - Functions to handle adding funds, withdrawing funds, and updating transaction history.

### 5. Create Mock Data

- **Initial State:** Set an initial balance and populate the transactions array with sample data.
- **Mock Functions:** Simulate API calls or backend interactions if needed.

### 6. Styling with Tailwind CSS

- Ensure the mock-up is responsive and aligns with the overall design language.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for spacing, typography, and layout adjustments.

### 7. Integrate Icons and Visuals

- Use relevant icons from `public/icons/` to enhance visual appeal.
- _Example:_ Use a piggy bank icon for balance display or transaction indicators.

### 8. Test the Mock-Up

- **Functionality:** Ensure all buttons and interactions work as intended.
- **Responsiveness:** Verify the design looks good on various screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:** Make sure the interface is accessible, with appropriate ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

### 9. Document the Implementation

- **Comments:** Add descriptive comments within the code to explain component purposes and functionalities.
- **CHANGELOG.md:** Update with details about the mock-up development under the `Added` section.

### 10. Review and Iterate

- **Share the Mock-Up:** Present the mock-up to team members for feedback.
- **Incorporate Feedback:** Make necessary adjustments based on feedback to refine the design and functionality.

## Progress Update

### Step 1: Basic Component Structure (Completed)

- Updated `components/piggy-bank.tsx` with a basic layout
- Implemented placeholders for main sections: balance display, action buttons, and transaction history
- Utilized existing UI components (Card, Button) for consistency
- Confirmed that the basic structure renders correctly in the application

### Step 2: Implement State Management (Completed)

- Added state variables for balance, transactions, and modal visibility
- Implemented handlers for adding and withdrawing funds
- Created and integrated AddFundsModal and WithdrawFundsModal components
- Confirmed functionality of adding and removing funds, updating balance, and recording transactions

### Step 3: Enhance User Interface (Completed)

- Implemented proper modals for adding and withdrawing funds
- Added form validation in the modals
- Ensured responsive design and consistent styling

## Next Steps

### Step 4: Refine Transaction History Display

- Improve the presentation of the transaction history
- Consider adding pagination or infinite scroll for large transaction lists
- Implement sorting and filtering options for transactions

### Step 5: Add Visual Indicators

- Integrate relevant icons from `public/icons/` to enhance visual appeal
- Consider adding animations for balance changes or successful transactions

### Step 6: Implement Data Persistence

- Plan integration with backend services for real data management
- Implement local storage solution for data persistence between sessions (as a temporary measure)

### Step 7: Accessibility Improvements

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Add appropriate ARIA labels and roles
- Test with screen readers and make necessary adjustments

### Step 8: Performance Optimization

- Optimize rendering of large transaction lists
- Implement lazy loading for transaction history if needed

### Step 9: Error Handling and Edge Cases

- Implement comprehensive error handling for all user interactions
- Handle edge cases such as network errors or data synchronization issues

### Step 10: Testing

- Write unit tests for PiggyBank component and related functions
- Implement integration tests for the entire Piggy Bank feature
- Conduct thorough manual testing across different devices and browsers
