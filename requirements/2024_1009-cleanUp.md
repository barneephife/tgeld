## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Review recent changes to ensure no new issues were introduced
- [ ] Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to reflect these changes and the plan to address them
- [ ] Implement handling of loading states or errors when fetching data (to be addressed when moving from mockDB to actual database)
- [ ] Add pagination and filtering capability to user and task lists
- [ ] Ensure role-based access control functionality exists at the sidebar level
- [ ] Replace <img> tags with <Image /> components from next/image in:
  - [ ] components/add-funds-modal.tsx
  - [ ] components/transactions-modal.tsx
  - [ ] components/withdraw-funds-modal.tsx
- [ ] Address remaining linter errors:
  - [ ] Resolve 'ParentChildModeProvider' JSX usage issue in components/client-layout.tsx
  - [ ] Fix type mismatch in components/user-management.tsx for fetchUsers and handleAddUser functions

## Next Steps

1. Address the remaining linter errors, starting with the most critical ones:
   a. Resolve the 'ParentChildModeProvider' JSX usage issue in components/client-layout.tsx
   b. Fix type mismatches in components/user-management.tsx
   c. Replace <img> tags with <Image /> components
2. Run the build process again after each set of changes to ensure issues are being resolved and no new ones are introduced.
3. Update the `PROJECT_STATUS.md` file to reflect these changes and the plan to address remaining issues.
4. Continue with the remaining tasks in the cleanup checklist.

## Additional Recommendations

- [ ] Consider consolidating `app/payday` and `app/piggy-bank` into a single financial management section
- [ ] Review `app/global-settings` and ensure it's being used consistently across the application
- [ ] Audit the `app/api` directory to ensure all API routes are necessary and follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Review and potentially refactor `app/lib` to ensure it contains only shared utility functions
- [ ] Review and update `requirements/PRD.md`, `requirements/_planDB.md`, and `requirements/codingPrinciples.md` to ensure they align with the current project state
- [ ] Review `tailwind.config.js` to ensure it's properly configured for the project's needs
- [ ] Audit `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to remove any unused dependencies and update to latest compatible versions

## Code Organization and Consistency Improvements

- [x] Move the `ExtendedUser` interface from `task-completion-page.tsx` to `app/types/user.ts` for better organization
- [ ] Review the naming convention for touch-based components (e.g., `touch-task-grid.tsx`, `touch-user-row.tsx`) and consider a more consistent approach
- [ ] Ensure consistent use of either single quotes or double quotes for string literals across all files

## Next Steps

1. Run the application and ensure there are no runtime errors related to the User interface changes.
2. If you have a linter set up, run it to catch any remaining linter issues.
3. Review any other components or files not mentioned here to ensure they're using the correct User interface.
4. Update the `PROJECT_STATUS.md` file to reflect recent changes.
5. Continue with the next task on the cleanup checklist.
