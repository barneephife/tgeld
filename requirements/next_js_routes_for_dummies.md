**Product Owner to Developer:**
Thank you for explaining. I am still learning a lot about coding and development and the languages/technologies in use in this project. It sounds to me that route.ts files are akin to SQL queries. Am I off-track in my simplistic understanding?

**Developer to Product Owner:**
Your understanding is on the right track, but let me clarify a bit more to give you a more accurate picture:

Route files in Next.js (like the route.ts files we're discussing) are not exactly like SQL queries, but they do serve a similar purpose in terms of data operations. Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. Route files in Next.js:

   - These define API endpoints for your application.
   - They handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for specific routes.
   - They often interact with data, but they're more about defining how your application responds to web requests.

2. SQL queries:

   - These are specific instructions to interact directly with a database.
   - They're used to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data in a database.

The connection between route files and SQL queries is that route files often contain logic that eventually leads to SQL queries being executed. Here's a typical flow:

    1. A client (like a web browser) sends a request to your API (defined in a route file).

    2. The route file receives this request and processes it.

    3. If the request requires data operations, the route file might call a function from a repository (like completedTaskRepository).

    4. The repository function then constructs and executes the actual SQL query.

So, while route files aren't SQL queries themselves, they're often the entry point that leads to SQL queries being executed.
In our project, the route files are defining the API structure and behavior, while the actual data operations (which often involve SQL queries) are abstracted away in the repository files (like completedTaskRepository.ts).

This separation of concerns (API logic in route files, data operations in repositories) is a common pattern in web development that helps keep code organized and maintainable.

Does this help clarify the relationship between route files and data operations in our project?
