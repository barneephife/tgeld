# Security Architecture

This document outlines the security architecture, practices, and considerations for Taschengeld.

## Overview

The security architecture is built on these core principles:
- Defense in depth
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by default
- Regular security updates

## Authentication

### JWT Implementation
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication
- Token expiration and rotation
- Secure token storage in HttpOnly cookies
- CSRF protection

### Password Security
- Argon2id password hashing
- Password complexity requirements
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Password reset with time-limited tokens

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Admin role: Full system access
- Parent role: Family management, task approval
- Child role: Task completion, piggybank access

### Permission Matrix
| Resource          | Admin | Parent | Child |
|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|
| User Management   | ✓     | -       | -     |
| Family Management | ✓     | ✓       | -     |
| Task Creation     | ✓     | ✓       | -     |
| Task Completion   | -     | -       | ✓     |
| Payment Approval  | ✓     | ✓       | -     |
| View Balance      | ✓     | ✓       | ✓     |

## Data Security

### Encryption
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- Database encryption at rest
- Secure key management
- File upload encryption

### Data Protection
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF tokens

## API Security

### Endpoint Protection
- Rate limiting
- Request size limits
- Valid HTTP methods only
- Secure headers

### API Authentication
- Bearer token authentication
- API key management
- Token refresh mechanism

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- Firewall configuration
- Network segregation
- Reverse proxy setup
- DDoS protection

### Container Security
- Minimal base images
- No root processes
- Resource limits
- Regular security scans

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Monitoring
- Failed login attempts
- Suspicious activity detection
- Resource usage monitoring
- Error rate tracking

### Audit Logging
- User actions
- System changes
- Access attempts
- Security events

## Incident Response

### Response Plan
1. Detection
2. Analysis
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons learned

### Security Contacts
- Security team contacts
- Incident reporting procedure
- External security resources

## Compliance

### Data Privacy
- GDPR compliance
- Data minimization
- User consent management
- Data retention policies

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Regular security audits
- Vulnerability assessments
- Penetration testing

## Development Security

### Secure Development
- Security code reviews
- Dependency scanning
- Static analysis
- Dynamic testing

### CI/CD Security
- Pipeline security checks

2. Impact assessment
3. Testing in staging
4. Production deployment
5. Verification

### Version Control
- Security patch tracking
- Dependency updates
- Version documentation
- Update notifications
