# Plan: Remove Role Column from Users Table

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…
The role column has been successfully removed from the application:
- Database schema updated
- API routes updated
- Frontend components updated
- No role-based filtering or styling remains

## Separate Issue: Type Definition Cleanup
There are some TypeScript errors remaining, but they are NOT related to role removal:
- Inconsistency between `user_id` and `id` fields
- Inconsistency between `soundurl` and `sound` fields
- `birthday` type mismatch (string vs Date)

These should be tracked and fixed in a separate task
