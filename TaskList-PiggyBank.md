# Piggy Bank Implementation Checklist

## Database Integration

- [x] Verify `piggybank_accounts` table schema
- [x] Verify `piggybank_transactions` table schema
- [x] Check for existing records in `piggybank_accounts` table
- [x] Check for existing records in `piggybank_transactions` table
- [x] Create `piggyBankAccountRepository` for database operations on `piggybank_accounts`
- [x] Create `piggyBankTransactionRepository` for database operations on `piggybank_transactions`

## API Routes

- [x] Implement GET route to fetch all piggy bank accounts
- [x] Implement GET route to fetch a specific piggy bank account by user ID
- [x] Implement POST route to create a new transaction (deposit or withdrawal)
- [x] Implement GET route to fetch transactions for a specific account

## Repository Functions

- [x] Implement `getAll` function in `piggyBankAccountRepository`
- [x] Implement `getByUserId` function in `piggyBankAccountRepository`
- [x] Implement `createAccount` function in `piggyBankAccountRepository` (if not exists)
- [x] Implement `updateBalance` function in `piggyBankAccountRepository`
- [x] Implement `addTransaction` function in `piggyBankTransactionRepository`
- [x] Implement `getTransactionsByAccountId` function in `piggyBankTransactionRepository`

## Component Updates

- [x] Update `PiggyBank` component to fetch real data from API instead of mock data
- [x] Update `AddFundsModal` to use real API for adding funds
- [x] Update `WithdrawFundsModal` to use real API for withdrawing funds
- [x] Implement error handling for insufficient balance in `WithdrawFundsModal`
- [x] Update transaction history to fetch from real API
- [x] Fix issues with form field reset and modal closure in `AddFundsModal` and `WithdrawFundsModal`
- [x] Implement optimistic updates for better user experience

## Real-time Updates

- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- [ ] Update `PiggyBank` component to listen for real-time updates
- [ ] Modify API routes to emit updates when transactions occur

## Testing

- [x] Test all API routes
- [x] Test all database operations
- [x] Test `PiggyBank` component with real data
- [x] Test `AddFundsModal` with real transactions
- [x] Test `WithdrawFundsModal` with real transactions
- [x] Test error handling for insufficient balance
- [ ] Test real-time updates (pending implementation)
- [x] Verify handling of existing records in the database

## Final Steps

- [x] Review and update error handling throughout the component
- [x] Ensure all existing UI elements and functionality are preserved
- [x] Update relevant documentation (CHANGELOG.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)
- [ ] Perform final end-to-end testing of the Piggy Bank feature
- [ ] Verify data consistency between the UI and the database

## Integration with Other Components

- [ ] Update User Management to display Piggy Bank account information
- [ ] Integrate Piggy Bank functionality with Payday component (if applicable)

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize database queries for large datasets

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement transaction categories for better organization
- [ ] Add data visualization for spending/saving trends
- [ ] Implement recurring transactions (e.g., allowance deposits)

## Notes

- Existing `piggybank_accounts` records should be used instead of creating new ones
- No data migration is needed for `piggybank_transactions` as the table is currently empty
- Consider implementing pagination for transaction history if the list grows large
