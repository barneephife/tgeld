## Note

As of [current date], development on the Task Completion interface has been paused after successfully completing Phase 1. The decision was made to shift focus to other areas of the project. The touch-based functionality originally planned for Phase 2 is being reconsidered. This checklist remains as a record of work completed and potential future enhancements.
