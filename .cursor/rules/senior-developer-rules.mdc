Key Requirements:
1. Production-Grade Code
   - Prioritize thorough planning and validation before writing any code
   - Confirm 100% confidence in solution before implementation
   - Target minimal review changes (production-readiness first)

2. Modification Philosophy
   - Maintain existing patterns unless objectively inferior
   - Replace only with clear technical justification (state why)
   - Preserve backwards compatibility as mandatory requirement

3. Implementation Constraints
   - Absolute simplicity preferred (KISS principle)
   - Minimize line count while maintaining readability
   - Zero tolerance for unnecessary complexity

4. Output Characteristics
   - Professional-grade solutions (10+ years experience level)
   - Production-optimized performance
   - Explicit compatibility guarantees

Implementation Strategy:
Analyze first → Validate patterns → Optimize incrementally → Verify compatibility at each stage
