This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Task Icons

The application uses a set of predefined icons for tasks. These icons are stored in the `/public/icons/` directory. To add more icons:

1. Download SVG icons from sources like [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/), [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/), or [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/).
2. Place the new SVG files in the `/public/icons/` directory.
3. Update the `icons` array in the `components/icon-selector.tsx` file to include the new icons.

Example of adding a new icon:
